# LTO releases rules on e-bike registration; Warns unlicensed drivers driving e-bikes

BY [ALABANGBULLETIN](https://www.alabangbulletin.com/author/alabangbulletin/ "Posts by AlabangBulletin") · FEBRUARY 13, 2018

Finally.

After it hit the market and a lot of people (old, young, slow, without helmets, without any driving experience, etc.) went out and bought them, the Land Transportation Office has finally came up with regulations on the registration of e-bikes.

Calling them Light Electric Vehicles or LEVs, LTO mentioned that they are now requiring registration of these vehicles as they have received numerous reports of unlicensed drivers driving e-bikes around the country.

Under Administrative Order AO-2006-01, registration steps are as follows:

**1. Complete the following requirements:**

– Commercial Invoice or Certificate of Registration from the country of origin  
– BOC Certificate of Payment  
– Certificate of Stock Reported (CSR)  
– Sales Invoice of MV with sales evaluation from the regional office  
– PNP-HPG MV Clearance Certification  
– Duly accomplished and approved Motor Vehicle Inspection Report (MVIR) issued by the MVIS accredited by the LTO  
– Appropriate insurance certificate of cover  
– Taxpayer’s Identification Number (TIN)

**2. Proceed to the transaction counters and submit all the required documents to the Evaluator for evaluation and computation of fees.**

**3. Undergo actual inspection of motor vehicles with duly accomplished MVIR. The form can be downloaded from the LTO website, and accomplished prior to your visit to the LTO.**

Now, all e-bikes involved in accidents can now be identified and receive penalties accordingly. Hopefully, these will also eliminate unlicensed riders on the roads.
