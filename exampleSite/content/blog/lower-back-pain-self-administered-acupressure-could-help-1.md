Why your Lead Acid Battery is all Swollen Up?

Sealed lead acid batteries – both AGM (absorption glass mat) and gelled electrolyte can swell up and expand sometimes. This happens due to the construction of lead acid batteries which is referred to as “recombinant”. They are constructed in such a way to allow absorption of gasses released during the chemical process inside the battery.

The positive and negative plates are placed very close together with only the thickness of the divider separating them. They are tightly secured in the cell cavity resulting in very little extra space inside the battery. When the cell plates expand, it exerts pressure on the inside walls of the battery. This situation can cause the battery case to swell resulting in possible splits and cracks at various points of the battery.

**Why Do Battery Cell Plates Expand?**

The cell plates most often expand due to overcharging of the battery. The battery may also expand due to shorting of the terminals of the battery. Both these situations result in heating up of the cell plates inside the battery. The lead of the cell plates has a high expansion rate when heated.

The outcome is that the battery experiences extreme pressure inside that swells up and deforms it. The swelling-up of the battery may also cause great damage to the internal components and parts.

**Why your Lead Acid Battery is all Swollen Up, how to Avoid Swelling Up of the Battery?**

Overcharging or short-circuiting of the battery is the only reason for swelling up of the lead acid battery. The problem is not inherent in the battery itself. In order to avoid swelling up of the battery you need to tackle the underlying cause of the problem.

You need to follow proper instructions in charging the battery. The culprit may be that you are using a wrong charger when charging the battery. If the charger is providing too much current, this may be the cause for battery swelling up. For instance, if you used 24V charger to charge a 12V battery it will most probably result in overcharging of the battery.

Whatever the reason for overcharging of the device, the end result is the swelling up of the battery. To avoid the prospect of overcharging or short-circuiting of the battery, you need to take the following precautions:

* Use the right type of [charger](https://www.nocheski.com/product-category/chargers/) that is fully compatible with the battery.
* Ensure proper polarity when connecting the charger to the battery
* Shield the battery terminals to avoid short-circuiting of the battery
* Use a charger whose maximum charging capacity is lower than the battery
* Using a good quality charger

Opinyun ng pinoy e-biker.

Ang karaniwang nasisira sa parte ng E-bike ay ang kanyang baterya

sapagkat sensetive ito at may tamang paggamit kaya naman may ilang mga tips para maiwasang masira o mas magtagal pa ang Life span ng ating baterya sa E-bike.

👉 Tips how to avoid bloated battery  
👉 Bawat ebike may specific charger

Ex : 12ah 48V / 20ah 48V / 20ah 60V  
20ah 72V

👉 Huwag maniwala na ang mga charger ay  
may timer at mag green kapag full charge.

👉 Huwag mag charge ng 8 oras at pataas.

👉 Huwag hintayin mag green ang charger  
para alam mo na full charge na battery

Paano kung 7 hours, 8 hours, 10 hours, 12 hours  
and so on, hindi pa nag green charger  
mo?

resulta ay overcharge  
👉 Bumili ng timer para sigurado sa  
oras na pag charge.  
👉 Tamang charge sa batterya kung  
lowbat na ay nasa 5 oras hangang  
6 oras lamang  
👉 Tanong : pwede ba I charge ang ebike  
namin kahit hinde pa lowbat?

Sagot: pwede po.. alamin mo kung ilang  
bar na sa panel board mo kung ilang bar  
na ang natitira( Malalaman mo ung  
accurate bar pag umaandar na ebike mo)

Halimbawa nakita mo 3 bar nalang pwede  
mo siya charge 2 hours, every bar na kulang  
equivalent 1 hour charging.

👉 Best tips: dapat ang pag charge ng battery  
ay nasa 5 oras o 6 na oras lamang  
kapag lowbat na.

👉 Tanong: pwede ba gumamit ng charger  
kahit hinde akma sa battery ko?

Sagot: Pwede at hindi

Pwede kung mataas ang specs charger  
sa battery mo.  
Ex: Battery is 12ah 48V  
pwedeng gamitin charger ay 20ah 48V  
pataas kaya lamang fast charger tawag dun

Ano ang fast charger?  
Pag gumamit ka na mas mataas na  
charger sa specific na battery mo.

Tanong: Ilang oras ba pwede I charge  
pag gumamit na fast charger?

Sagot: 2 oras lamang o 3 oras depende  
sa ginagamit mong fast charger.
