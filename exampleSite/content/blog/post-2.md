#### 1. IT'S FUN!

An electric bike is guaranteed to put a smile on your face - every ride!

#### 2. SAVE MONEY

Petrol prices may soar, but electric bikes offer a genuine transportation alternative for just pennies per charge. A full charge costs about 10p and will take you up to 56 km. That's the equivalent of 1,500 to 2,000 miles per gallon!  
Parking costing you an arm and a leg? Ride to work and save hundreds more in parking fees not to mention the cost-savings from less wear and tear on your car. Give up your car altogether and save even more on tax and insurance!

#### 3. CLEAN, GREEN ENERGY

If thoughts of global warming leave you cold, consider this: Compared to a car, moped or motorcycle, an electric bike provides a clean, green, no-petrol transportation alternative.  
Electric bikes typically consume fuel at an average rate of 100 to 150 watts of electrical energy compared to 15,000 or so for a car.

#### 4. GET THERE FASTER

Avoid the time delays and frustration of getting caught in traffic congestion. Did you know average rush hour car speed is just 16mph? An electric bike can take advantage of the network of bicycle and multi-purpose paths, giving access to routes that cars and motorcycles cannot reach.  
The result: a faster door-to-door journey!

#### 5. GENUINELY SUSTAINABLE

While there's a lot of talk about sustainability in transportation, an electric bicycle can be made genuinely sustainable. Purchase electricity from a "green" supplier and the bike's fossil fuel consumption will be zero. You can help to "change the world one bike at a time."
